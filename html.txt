SVG stands for Scalar Vector Graphics; markup lang for describinh two dimensional based vector graphics.
<svg> element is used; its a container for SVG graphics;
 it defines a new coordinate system to design theses graphics.
 
 <!-- 


 x1 = Starting X position(left to right)  
 y1 = Starting Y position (top to bottom)  
 x2 = Ending X position  
 y2 = Ending Y position  

<svg width="200" height="200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <line x1="10" y1="10" x2="150" y2="100" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" />
</svg>

 This draws a **line** from `(10,10)` to `(150,100)` with a black stroke. 

What does xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" mean?
It defines the XML namespace for an SVG document.

Breaking it Down Simply:
xmlns stands for XML Namespace.
"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" is the official namespace for SVG.
It tells the browser: "Hey, this file contains SVG elements, not just regular XML or HTML. -->
